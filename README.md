# Employee Payroll checker

In this web application, we are creating an emmployee payroll tracker that will record :

- First name
- Last Name
- Salary

There is a loop in place to offer the user the ability to enter multiple user information(s) until the user record information is satisfied. 
The app will then log each entry to an array and populate them to a UI table.

There are error checks in place to ensure accurate data is recorded (e.g. if fields are empty, or salary data is non-numeric, an invalid input error is thrown on both the UI pop-up and within the console).

There is a feature that will record all employees salary's within the listed array and average the salary out, and then log it to the browser console. 
There is a feature that will randomly select an employee from the array and log to the console
